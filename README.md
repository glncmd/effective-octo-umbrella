A collection of python scripts for graphic design projects

---

### face-crop
Given multiple pictures of persons, this script searches for the location of a face in each one, and crops it to the framing and dimensions of an ID picture.

This saves time and effort by automating the task of manually cropping a collection of pictures with different framing, sizes, formats, and resolutions. This is effective, for example, in ID card projects.

### ps-actions
Opens each page of a .pdf file and performs a pre-recorded PS action on each one. The script then saves each page as a separate .psd file.

The combination of scripting and PS actions, as demonstrated in this script, can be very powerful in automating most of the repetitive tasks in Photoshop! :)
